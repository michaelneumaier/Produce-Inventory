## How to use

### Create Inventory

1. First, you must add products to your inventory list. You can either:
    - Add products manually
    - Import an inventory file
2. In the Edit Products screen, select or deselect products you don't want to count(e.g. Out of Season products). You can also long-press products to rearrange to the order you would like.

### Take Inventory
Now that you have all the products you wish to manage, simply use the buttons on the right of each product to take inventory.

You can inventory in increments of half cases or whole cases.

If you have already taken inventory previously, you can tap "Clear Counts" and will set all product counts to 0.

You have a few ways to sort the products you wish to inventory:
- Swipe from the left or press the hamburger icon on the top left.
  - You can show only Organic PLU products (only PLUs starting with a 9)
  - You can show only Packaged products (non 4 or 5 digit PLUs)
- Tap the Product Category dropdown to count from specific commodities

### Review Inventory

On the Review screen, you can review all of the products that you inventoried. If you need to change or add products, simply go back to the Inventory screen to make changes.

### Scan Inventory

Finally, after inventorying, and reviewing, you can scan all of the products using your company's handheld device.
1. Scan barcode on handheld.
2. Input the amount of cases you inventoried
3. Swipe up to go to the next product, or swipe down to go back

### Options
In the Options screen, you have the ability to save and load inventory files. The files are saved as JSON files to your downloads folder and can be used to share with others or used as a backup.

### Final Thoughts
When set up properly, this tool can help to easily and quickly inventory your products without wasting paper or having to flip through an order guide.

When you're done scanning, you can always go back to the Review screen to have a clear idea of the products you scanned.

You will not be able to scan the barcodes using an older 1D Laser style barcode scanner.
